              <p4><b>Biography:</b><br>
                Avani Singh is an attorney of the High Court of South Africa and a certified mediator.
                Her work focuses on constitutional and human rights law with a specialisation in media freedom,
                digital rights and emerging technology. Avani holds B.Comm. (Law) and LL.B. degrees from the
                University of Pretoria, and consults to a wide range of clients across organs of state, human rights
                oversight bodies, civil society, media organisations, online platforms and the private sector across
                South Africa, the region and further abroad. Avani is the current board chair of Media Monitoring Africa
                and a council member of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, and serves as
                a technical expert to the working group set up to develop guidelines on social media for electoral
                management bodies.
                <br>
                Avani’s experience brings together litigation, advocacy, research and training, often as multi-pronged
                strategies that compliment each other. She has practised as an attorney in the Media Law team at Webber
                Wentzel
                and the Constitutional Litigation Unit at the Legal Resources Centre, and has clerked at the
                Constitutional Court
                of South Africa and the International Criminal Court. Between 2017/2018, Avani co-founded a tech law
                consultancy
                and a public interest law firm, ALT Advisory and Power Singh Inc. respectively, which together pioneered
                a private-public
                interest law model to widen access to justice for indigent clients.
                <br>
                Domestically, Avani has represented clients at all levels of the judicial system, in various
                parliamentary and law reform processes,
                as well as before regulatory mechanisms, constitutionally-mandated bodies and commissions of inquiry.
                This also integrates with her
                work at the regional and international levels, including before fora such as the African Union, African
                Commission on Human and Peoples
                Rights, Pan-African Parliament, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic,
                Social and Cultural Rights.
                In all respects, Avani’s work is driven by an overarching aim towards the meaningful realisation of the
                right of all persons to receive
                and impact information and ideas, both on- and offline, by empowering the public to advocate for their
                rights, make informed decisions
                and fully participate in the democratic process.
